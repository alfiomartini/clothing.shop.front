# Clothing Shop

This is a React application that allows users to browse and buy different types of clothing. The global state is managed with the _Redux_ library, and a certain amount of data persistence is supported for the items added to the shopping cart. Authentication and database support is implemented with Googles's _Firebase_ platform. Credit card payment is achieved through the use of _Stripe_ (test mode only), while React components are styled with _SASS_ and _Styled Components_. The program itself is a reconstruction/adaptation/extension of an original application developed by Yihua Zhang and it is (mostly) developed with React/Javascript.
