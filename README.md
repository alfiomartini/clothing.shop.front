# Clothing Shop

This is a React application that allows users to browse and buy different types of clothing, including hats, sneakers, jackets as well as mens's and women's specific types of clothes. The global state is managed by _redux_ and a certain amount of data persistence is supported for the items added to the shopping cart. Authentication and database support is implemented with Googles's _Firebase_ platform. Credit card payment is achieved through the use of _Stripe_ (test mode only), while React components are styled with _SASS_ and _styled components_.
